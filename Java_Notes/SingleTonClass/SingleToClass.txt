problem statement:

Raj have a class and he have some set of values say like setters and getters.

problem is, every time he need to create an object for the class to access the items.

he dont know wheter he had already craeted an object to the class or not, we all know that what will happen if every time an object is created.

can you suggest a best way to make raj to create only one object one at a time? if possible let us know on what basis you are suggesting a solution?



so to answer this question, we should know the concept of "Singleton class"

make the user to create an object only once.

Rules:
=================
1.make all the variables to be private
2.make the constructor to be private
3.create all the methods depends on your case as public
4.out of all the method have a method which is helping us to check wheter an object is already created or not.
