Json:

Java script object notation

JSON is a very light weighted data format

it stores data in key and value pairs.

when we start using json data we should know the format of inserting data into a json file.

syntax:

{

"key":"value",
"key":[
	{
		"key":"value"
	}

]

}


"key":"value"----plain json object
[]---->> json array

inside json array again we can expect one or more jsonobject 



we can not have duplicate key inside a json file.

where should i use this json file in my selenium test automation?

user can use this json file as a data source inorder to pass the data to the testcases.


steps involved in reading the jsondata:

1.Use file reader to read the jsonfile
2.Use a parser to scan or parse the json file that was read by the file reader
3.store the data into the Object class 
4.parse the Object with the json object to get the data
