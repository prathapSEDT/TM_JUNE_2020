How can we implement collection object list in selenium?


we all know that list is used to store collection objects either with same type or different also it allows the duplicates.


in our testing process some time we may need to do the following operations:

	1. collect all the links and check if they are broken or not
	2. collect all the elements that are available under a parent
	3. print only the visible link or button etc in the application


where ever there is scope of getting multiple elements we uyse list in place to handle the scenrio automation

in sleenium to store mulytiple element using list we use the following syntax

syntax:

List<WebElement> refvar=driver.findElements(By.locator);


now here we can store mutiple elements in alsit of type WebElement


to get all the links from the page i can use either xpath or i can use locator by.tag



can we check and print only the visible links on the page?

yes we should iterate the collection object and get each link
when you get each link , use a method called isDisplayed

isDisplayed is the method which is used to check if the element is exist or not

to get the text from a paired html tag, the method name is getText()

here the link is a paired htmltag, so we can apply gettext method on the link object


How isDisplayed method will work?

The element should be display on the front end aswell as in DOM, if the elment is not perfroming the both you will get an exception

to overcome this execption we need to surround with try and catch block
