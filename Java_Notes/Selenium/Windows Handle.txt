set is a interface which is implemented in hashset

set will not allow duplicates

set will not have indexing , so you cant retrive the details from the set using index position

the position of values will be random


syntax:

Set<Type> refvar=new HashSet<Type>;


Where will use Set in selenium?

where we try to automate child browsers on the application we use Set interface

Child browsers or any browser that we automate will have a window associated with it

each window will have a id mapped to it

some time, when we open a browser, we might get soem child browsers getting opened along with the parent browser.

user may need to switch to any window and pperform operations
user may need to close the child window

either or the operation, we need to handl the windows

in order to handle the windows in selenium we have two methods

	* getWindowHandle()----- will get the parent window ID in string format
	* getWindowHadles()---- will get the ID of all opened browsers id including parent window in a set
because windows ID should not be a duplicate
