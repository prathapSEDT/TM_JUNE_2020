How to handle Ajax controls?

Ajax controls are very common controls that we face in regular application testing.
ajax is the one of the functionality available in the application developement
rather than loading whole page on the application, load only a particular section or div alone.

for ex: when you try to search something in the search box, automatically you may come across some search results, now we need test that the search results are accurate?

Ram want to search something in yahoosearch page, when he start searching automatically there are few search results getting displayed

now he need to search wheter the result what he got is styarting with the input he has given

ex:

input as python

all results must starts with python only.
