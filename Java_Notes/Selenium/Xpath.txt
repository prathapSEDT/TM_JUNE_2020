Xpath:

How to identify the elements using xpath?

xpath is used to identify the elements on the DOM structire of the HTML page

DOM is called as Document Object Model.

DOM is used to visualize the pysical structure of the elemenyt on the webpage.

to start seeing the physical structure of an element we need do inspection of the html page.

in this xpath we should know the basic structure of the HTML page


<HTML>

	<head>

		<title>....<title>
	</head>

<body>

	// webelements

</body>


</HTML>


Here HTML is called as Root element.

Earlier days to identi any element on the DOM structure, people will take the refferece of the root elememt in order to identify an element



/html/body/div[6]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a

it is difficult to track the element
Time consuming process
poor in performance as it takes more time to identify an element on the page.


writting xpath in this fasjion is a bad pratice.

now to over come this xpath which is called as absolute xpath, is replaced with "Relative xpath"


so xpath is catorized in two ways

	* Absolute xpath(not a good way to identify)
	* Relative xpath(preffereable)


what is meant by relative xpath?

in the relative xpath we will try to identify exactly what element you want to work with.
in this relative xpath, we use the properties of the element given by the developer

properties are called as attributes.

syntax of writing simple relative xpath is:

//----- it indicates the xpath is relative xpath

//htmltag[@attribute,'value']

attributes might be 

id,name,class,or anything that waht a developer had given at the time of development

these attributes might be dynamic natutre.

once you identifuied an element ensure that , the properties that you used to identify an element is statiic


how can i know wheter the properties are dynamic or not?

execute the script every time launching a new browser instance.
if the script fail, check the property what it is having in the curent state, what is the property that is available while you design.

see what is changing, and we make moddification accordingly.

when ever we write an xpath it should be always a strong xpath.

To handle the dynamic properties of the element we have different types of relative xpath 

1.Function based xpath, all the function are java script based function
2.farwrd xpath--- identify the elements using the relationship
3.bacward xpath ---identify the elements using the relationship
4.logical xpath

all the above listed types will depend on the simple syantax of relative xpath only.

to write any type of relative xpath first we should knnow teh basic writting of the reative xpath.


HTML Tag:
<input type="text" data-val="true" data-val-required="First name is required." id="FirstName" name="FirstName">


<input---- htmltag

all other after the html tag is called as attributes or properties.


when there is an id, without any numerics in place and you dont have any unreadble text, use the id property.

id is used to identify aan element more uniquely.

//htmltag[@attribute='value']

//input[@id='FirstName']


i dont have aproperty to identify an element on the page.in such cases there are multiple ways to write a xpath for those elements.

1.check the html tag, if the html tag is <a> use the function based xpath 

what are the function based xpath available

1.text()
syntax:

//htmltag[text()='text or innertext or inner HTML']

we all know that , <a> is called as "paired html tag"

<a>INNER TEXT</a>

inner text is called as text


when the inner text have special charcter , this method will not work
Ex:Today's Deals

2.Normalize-space---80% dont know
some times, when we identify an element using text, we may get the inner text with spaces at starting and at ending

based on the browser types these space will get differ, you may have or you may not have or you may more spaces in place

when you identify an elemet with the text method ensure you dont have a space for the innertext

//htmltag[normalize-space(text())='text without spaces']


3.()----group

when we identify any element using xpath, if you get more element when you identify.
use group to get your element.

suppose for my xpath i got 15 elements
my element is at 10th place, use group and identifify the element

syntax
(elementxpath)[number]


4.last() 
this method must use inside the [], to get everytime last element

5.starts-with()

when the attribue values are constant only at the starting position and rest of them are getting cahnged in runtime then use this method called as starts-with

//htmltag[starts-with(@attribute,'value')]
//htmltag[starts-with(text(),'value']
ex:

when i identify an element my id is looking like below

id=ABC1256
ABC745689
ABC124589
ABC_POPLI


if we observer correctly the starting position ABC alone is constant and rest of the property is getting canged.

i ll use startswith to identify my element, but here there are chances to get one or more elements


if the html tag is paired html tag with inner text
ex: Welcome Admin
Welcome User
Welcome Prathap

only welcome is constant, rest is dynamic in nature.
