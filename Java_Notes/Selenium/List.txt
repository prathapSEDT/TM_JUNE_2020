Inn java there is concept called collections

in collection we have different types

1.List
2.Set
3.Queue


**** Map


Queue is not a mandatory for the QA to implement, tehy use in Dev process.

why collection are important?

as we have disadvantages in array, we moved towards collections

arrays does not supposrt to have resizing
array will not allow to insert new elements in runtime at any specific psotion
array wil not allow to delete an element


to over come all these problem collections are introduced.

List:

List is an interface
List methods are implemented in a class called "ArrayList"
in the list all the elements are stored in the indexing manner
index will start from 0
list allows the user to have a null value
list allows the user to have duplicate value
list will allows the user to do manipulation like insert or delete
list have its own iterator and also list can be itearte over a loop
list is a type safety

if you declared the with some datattype, it will stor ethe element only with that particular type only

syntax to create a list:

List<any class name or datatype>  someref=new ArrayList<any class name or datatype>

here if we wont specify the class name then it will be consider as "Genericc: type

generic type mean user can add a type values


methods:

add()
get(index)
iterator
size()
add(int index, object)
remove(object)
remove(index)
contains()

user can also add a new list to the existing list by using a method called addAll()
user can check if one list type is avalaibale in another list called containsAll()


to clear all the objects in the list we use a method called as clear()


explore the difference between list and arraylist
explore stream on collection object
difference btn failSafe and failFast
